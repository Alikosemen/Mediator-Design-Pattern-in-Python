# Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral design blueprint facilitating communication among objects by centralizing interactions through a mediator object. It acts as a liaison, enabling objects to interact without direct dependencies, thereby promoting loose coupling and minimizing intricate inter-object connections.

## When to Use the Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern is handy in software when:

1. **Managing Communication**: Use it when lots of objects talk to each other, but you want to keep their chats organized through a middleman.
2. **Reducing Dependencies**: Employ it to keep things from getting too attached to each other, making changes easier.
3. **Handling Complex Interactions**: Use it for systems with many moving parts that need controlled interactions without becoming a tangled mess.

## Practical Example: A Message Broker

Letâ€™s produce a simple Message Broker to demonstrate how the Mediator pattern works in practice. This broker will act as a middleman, allowing different parts of a system to send and receive messages without directly knowing about each other. Using this Message Broker, components can talk to each other without worrying about the nitty-gritty details, making the system more flexible and easier to manage. This example will showcase the essence of the Mediator pattern by decoupling message senders and receivers through an intermediary broker.

## Terminology and Key Components

In the Mediator pattern, understanding key elements is crucial:

1. **Components**: Classes containing business logic, linked to a mediator for reusability without knowing its specific class.
2. **Mediator Interface**: Declares communication methods, allowing components to interact without directly coupling.
3. **Concrete Mediators**: Manage relationships between components, holding references to and coordinating their actions without their explicit awareness.
